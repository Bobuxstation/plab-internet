        The indie game development team, AB Studios has released a new game called city which has won the
        Penendale game of the year award. No wonder city won the Penendale game award as the game is just so epik.
        With insanely realistic graphics and Infinite lore, there is no end to this epik game. <br><br>

        Imagine being in a super realistic world, waking up in a mansion surrounded by other mansion.
        The nature is beautiful with varying trees and varying buildings like the Robloxia house and the
        CITY&trade; mansion. With a never ending lore which City is the first one to achieve in the gaming industry.
        City might just be the best game ever created. <br><br>
